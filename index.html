When investigating this regional aspect, one can make several observations: </p> <ul> <li> Cantons of Central Switzerland: All these cantons have lower proportion of Single Family Homes (all below <span class="h-kpi-g">50 %</span> of the total number of buildings). </li> <li> Cantons of <span class="h-kpi-g">Eastern Switzerland and Lake Geneva</span> Region: These cantons show the exact opposite to the cantons of Central Switzerland. The proportion of Single Family Homes is in general over 50 % </li> <li> Big Cities: The two cantons of Zurich (ZH) and Bern (BE) are obvious outliers in this plot. Due to their big cities (e.g., Zurich, Winterthur, Bern, Thun) they lay far more on the right side of the plot and stand out compared to the other cantons. </li> </ul> <p> These observations underline some facts that we already know: Firstly, the Cantons of Eastern Switzerland are known to be more rural and focused on agriculture and farming. Cities and villages are relatively small and less populated. This leads to the areas being less in demand and therefore, the price of land might be considerably more affordable when compared to other cantons (see more on that later -> Sabrina). Secondary, Cantons like Zug (ZG) have a lower tax load so hounding tends to be more expensive (see more on that later -> Sabrina). </p> </div> <div class="c-v1_2-right chart-container"> <div id="s1-chart"></div> </div> </div> </div>  <div class="section"> <div class="content"> <div class="c-v1_2-right text"> <h2>Swiss real estate market trends</h2> <h3>Subheading Message 1</h3> <p> As can be seen from the chart, real estate prices in Switzerland have shown a continuous increase over the past 5 years, especially for new buildings and apartments.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. </p> <a href="https://example.com/" target="_blank"> <button class="ref-btn">Visit our Page!</button> </a> </div> </div> </div>  <div class="section"> <div class="content"> <h2 class="ref-title">References</h2> <div class="ref-box ref-data"> <h3>Data</h3> </div> <div class="ref-box ref-doc"> <h3>Documentation</h3> <div class="ref-item-container"> <a href target="_blank"> <div class="ref-item"> <img class="ref-icon" src="documentation.2a77314e.svg" alt="datareport"> Data Preperation & Report </div> </a> <a href target="_blank"> <div class="ref-item"> <img class="ref-icon" src="personas.6b7b4aba.svg" alt="personas"> Personas for this Data Story </div> </a> </div> </div> <div class="ref-box ref-code"> <h3>Code & Tech Stack</h3> <div class="ref-item-container"> <a href="https://github.com/JohnTrunix/vdss" target="_blank"> <div class="ref-item"> <img class="ref-icon" src="github.c58a30b1.svg" alt="github"> Github Repository (Source Code) </div> </a> <a href="https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/" target="_blank"> <div class="ref-item"> <img class="ref-icon" src="fullpagejs.1145afda.svg" alt="fullpagejs"> FullPage.js (Page Scrolling Library) </div> </a> <a href="https://apexcharts.com/" target="_blank"> <div class="ref-item"> <img class="ref-icon" src="apexcharts.4462c51b.svg" alt="apexcharts"> Apexcharts (Chart Library) </div> </a> <a href="https://quarto.org/" target="_blank"> <div class="ref-item"> <img class="ref-icon" src="quarto.6076b7af.svg" alt="quarto"> Quarto (Document Generation) </div> </a> </div> </div> <div class="ref-box ref-other"> <h3>Information & Disclaimer</h3> <p class="ref-disclaimer"> Please note that this storytelling website is a module final project created solely for academic purposes.
